_If you're looking for the giant list of links which was here before, it has been moved to the [Voice Index](http://caster.readthedocs.org/en/latest/caster/doc/readthedocs/Voice%20Index/) page of the docs._

Caster is a collection of tools aimed at enabling programming entirely by voice. It runs on top of [Dragonfly](https://github.com/Danesprite/dragonfly), which runs on either Dragon NaturallySpeaking or Windows Speech Recognition.
