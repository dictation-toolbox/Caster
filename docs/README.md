[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dictation-toolbox/Caster.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dictation-toolbox/Caster) [![ReadTheDocs Build Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pip/badge/)](https://caster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

[Caster](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/Caster)  is a collection of tools aimed at enabling programming and accessibility entirely by voice built upon the [Dragonfly](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/dragonfly) API.

**Note for PyPi Users**: The PIP package is (_Alpha_). Do not use the PIP install. Alternatively use this [Master Branch](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/Caster) with classic install for the best feature experience.

- Caster Command Reference Guides 
  - [Caster](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/Caster/blob/master/CasterQuickReference.pdf) - commands to get started with. Universal navigation and editing - These commands are active all the time, and provide input commands for letters, numbers and punctuation, as well as the ability to easily manipulate windows and text. 
    - `window right` moves the active window to the right-hand side of the screen.
    - `prekris` inserts a pair of brackets `()` and moves the cursor inside them.
    - `shackle` selects the current line.
  - [Applications](https://caster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readthedocs/Application_Commands_Quick_Reference/) - Application specific control - These commands are only activated when a particular program is the active window, and they provide support for text editors, IDEs, web browsers etc. For example, while the Sublime text editor is the active window, saying
    - `find` will execute a `ctrl-f` keystroke, bringing up the find and replace prompt,
    - `open file` will execute a `ctrl-o` keystroke,
    - `edit next <n>` - `ctrl-d` n times, selecting the next n instances of the currently selected word.
  - [Program Languages](https://caster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readthedocs/CCR_languages_Quick_Reference/) - Language specific coding - These modules are activated and deactivated with the `enable/disable <language>` voice command. For example say `enable python`. 
    - `for loop` which will insert `for i in range(0, ):`
    - `print to console` - `print()`
    - `open file` -  `open('filename', 'r') as f:`
