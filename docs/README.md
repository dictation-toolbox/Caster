[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dictation-toolbox/Caster.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dictation-toolbox/Caster) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/caster/badge/?version=latest)](https://caster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) ![GitHub top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/dictation-toolbox/Caster)[![https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/Caster/blob/master/LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GNU-informational)](https://matrix.to/#/!KOGBGqVOBKJjKLgFUY:matrix.org?via=matrix.org)

â€‹	[Caster](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/Caster) gives you the power to control your computer by voice. Take control of your applications, games, mouse and keyboard to augment your workflow for every day activities or as an accessibility tool to develop applications entirely by voice built upon the [Dragonfly](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/dragonfly) framework.  

**Note for PyPi Users**: The PIP package is (_Alpha_). Do not use the PIP install. Alternatively use this [Master Branch](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/Caster) with classic install for the best feature experience.

- Caster Command Reference Guides:

  - [Caster](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/Caster/blob/master/CasterQuickReference.pdf) - Universal navigation and editing -  These voice commands are active all the time and provide input commands for letters, numbers, and punctuation, as well as the ability to easily manipulate windows and text. 
    - `window right` moves the active window to the right-hand side of the screen.
    - `prekris` inserts a pair of brackets `()` and moves the cursor inside them.
    - `shackle` selects the current line
  - [Applications](https://caster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readthedocs/Caster_Commands/Application_Commands_Quick_Reference/) - Application specific control - These commands are only activated when a particular program is the active window, and they provide support for text editors, IDEs, web browsers etc. For example, while the Sublime text editor is the active window, saying
    - `find` will execute a `ctrl-f` keystroke, bringing up the find and replace prompt,
    - `open file` will execute a `ctrl-o` keystroke,
    - `edit next <n>` - `ctrl-d` n times, selecting the next n instances of the currently selected word.
  - [Program Languages](https://caster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readthedocs/Caster_Commands/CCR_languages_Quick_Reference/) - Language specific coding - These modules are activated and deactivated with the `enable/disable <language>` voice command. For example after saying `enable python`, the following commands become available for dictation: 
    - `for loop` which will insert `for i in range(0, ):`
    - `print to console` - `print()`
    - `open file` -  `open('filename', 'r') as f:`
