# Using Voice Commands

Caster is a large project and it may be overwhelming. We recommend to start small.

For those that simply want to leverage voice control with their computer we recommend starting with [Application Commands Quick Reference](https://caster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readthedocs/Application_Commands_Quick_Reference/). An example for Firefox. Open up Firefox then say `enable Firefox` this makes commands available.

- ` go forward [<n>] / go back [<n>] `  navigates history forward and back  with `n` being the number you specify for example saying `go back 2` two pages back that were previously visited.

- `new tab`  opens up a new tab

- `google that` Google's the highlighted text from by mouse

For those that are looking for accessibility for complete keyboard mouse and replacement we recommend [Caster's Quick Reference](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/Caster/blob/master/CasterQuickReference.pdf) guide. The document contains universal commands for navigation and editing. 

These commands are active all  the time, and provide input commands for letters, numbers and  punctuation, as well as the ability to easily manipulate windows and  text. A few examples from the document are:

- `window right` moves the active window to the right-hand side of the screen.
- `prekris` inserts a pair of brackets `()` and moves the cursor inside them.
- `shackle` selects the current line.

As you progress through the documentation you will learn how to customize existing commands and create your own. Looks correct here
