# Using Voice Commands

Caster is a large project, and it can be overwhelming as it requires a shift in how you think about your computer.  This shift involves using your voice - not just a mouse or a keyboard. Regardless of whether you are using Caster to augment your workflow or completely control your computer by voice, we recommend starting small. Pick one application and become familiar with its voice commands. Once you become familiar with the application, start learning other commands incrementally. 

For those that simply want to leverage voice control with their computer, we recommend starting with [Application Commands Quick Reference](https://caster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readthedocs/Caster_Commands/Application_Commands_Quick_Reference/). An example for the Firefox application: Open up Firefox then say `enable Firefox`. This makes commands available.

- ` go forward [<n>] / go back [<n>] `  navigates history forward and back with `n` being the number you specify for example. Saying `go back 2` causes the browser to navigate two pages back from where you were. 

- `new tab`  opens up a new tab

- `google that` Googles the highlighted text

For those that are looking for complete keyboard and mouse replacement as an Accessibility tool, we recommend [Caster's Quick Reference](https://caster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readthedocs/Caster_Commands/CasterQuickReference/). The document contains universal commands for navigation and editing. 

These commands are active all the time and provide input commands for letters, numbers, and  punctuation, as well as the ability to easily manipulate windows and text. A few examples from the document are:

- `window right` moves the active window to the right-hand side of the screen.
- `prekris` inserts a pair of brackets `()` and moves the cursor inside them.
- `shackle` selects the current line.

As you progress through the documentation, you will learn how to customize existing commands and create your own.
