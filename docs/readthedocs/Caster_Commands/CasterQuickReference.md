Beginners should start by reviewing the [Caster Quick Reference PDF](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/Caster/blob/master/CasterQuickReference.pdf) with universal commands for navigation and editing.

These commands are active all the time and provide input commands for letters, numbers, and punctuation, as well as the ability to easily manipulate windows and text. A few examples from the document are: 

- `window right` moves the active window to the right-hand side of the screen.
- `prekris` inserts a pair of brackets `()` and moves the cursor inside them.
- `shackle` selects the current line.
