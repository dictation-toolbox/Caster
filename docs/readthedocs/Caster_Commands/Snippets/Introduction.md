# Sublime Snippets

## Motivation


So what Caster currently offers for sublime users is the ability

-  to have all of your snippets on the grammar side

-  to have multiple variants of the same snippet 

-  to generate them dynamically(!!)

-  to easily switch between those variants and post-process snippets

-  to execute arbitrary sublime commands, not limited just to snippets!

all the while without needing a single line of code running on the sublime side, so there is nothing you need to do additionally install! The only thing you might have to take care off yourself is the [subl path issue](#subl-path) but for most users these should be handled automatically.
