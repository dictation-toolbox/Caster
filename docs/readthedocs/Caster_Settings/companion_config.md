# Companion Rules

â€‹	The `companion_config.toml` allows you to set multiple rules as companions.  A child companion `MergeRules ` grammar is linked to its parent `MergeRules ` grammar Enabled/Disabled state. When the parent grammar state changes so does it's child companions.

- Enabling a parent rule with a companion enables them both
- Disabling the rule which enabled the companion disables the companion
- Disabling the companion does NOT disable the parent rule

Consider the following example `Python = ["PythonNon"]` 

`Python ` is the parent rule and `PythonNon` is its child. If you say  `Enable Python` then not only `Python` but also `PythonNon` rule would become enabled.

Guide to creating your own companions

- The names are the exact class names of the rule.

- The rule `parent rule` must be MergeRules and a the `child` MappingRules.
- Caution it is possible to have a companion rule circle, which  is to say, an infinite loop.
