## Rules

All rules managed by Caster are tracked in this config file `rules.toml `located in `AppData\Local\caster\settings`. This configuration file allows you not only to see what rules are active but change with the whitelist which rules are loaded by Caster during startup.

Rules can exist in different states:

- `Loaded ` During startup Caster loads all available rules on startup into the speech recognition engine. If a rule is not loaded, it cannot be `enabled`/`disabled`, and the rule's commands cannot be recognized. 

- `Active`/`Inactive ` rule state denotes whether or not a rule is available for recognition.
  For instance if you say `disable Firefox`, the Firefox rule will become  `Inactive `. When the Firefox application is launched, the commands will not be available for recognition until the Firefox rule is set to `active`  with the `enable Firefox` command. 

### Enabled Ordered

Enabled ordered represents all  `active` rules. When you `enable` the rule, its class name is added to the `_enabled_ordered` list. When the rule is `disabled`, it is removed from the list. It's a great way to see what rules are currently available. Note: This list should not be modified manually.

### Internal Rules

A handful of rules get special treatment by the `Grammar Manager` as represented in `_internal`. These "internal" rules are the rules which are generated by/for Caster loaded content. They do not belong in the set of rules which can be reloaded. You *can* turn them off, but it is strongly discouraged as they are required for Caster to function.

### WhiteList

The number of Caster rules has grown immensely in the past few years, which is great, but means that the initial load time has grown as well. In order to reduce boot time, a WhiteList has been added to allow the user to control which rules get `loaded`. Most users will not be using all of the available rules, so it does not make sense to encumber users with unused rules.

New users will be provided a core set of starter rules to get started with and then expected to manage which rules load for them via the `[whitelisted]` feature. Rules are defined as true in the Whitelist load when Caster starts. However if a rule is set to false, it is not loaded and therefore cannot be enabled or disabled.

- All rules loaded by Caster including from `AppData\Local\caster\Rules` (user made) and `Documents\Caster\castervoice\Rules` (Caster Starter Rules) will automatically be added to `[whitelisted]` as `true` during startup when the rule is first detected.
- Caster must be restarted for changes in `[whitelisted]` to take effect.

The following `rules.toml `is a mock representation of the default settings. `_enabled_ordered` shows the default enabled grammars when Caster first starts. Defaults may vary by Caster version and engine.
