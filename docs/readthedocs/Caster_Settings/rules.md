## Rules

All rules managed by Caster are tracked in this config file `rules.toml `located in located in `AppData\Local\caster\settings`. This configuration file allows you not only to see what grammars are `active` but `whitelist` which grammars even get loaded by Caster during startup.

### Enabled Ordered

`"_enabled_ordered"` represents all `active` grammars. When you `enable` the grammar Its rule class name Is added to the list. When the grammar is `disabled`  It is removed from the list. It's a great way to see what grammars are currently available. Note: This list should not be modified by manually.

### Internal Rules

A handful of rules get special treatment as represented by the list in `_internal` by the GrammarManager. These "internal" rules are the rules which are generated by/for Caster loaded content. They do not belong in the set of rules which can be reloaded. You *can* turn them off but it is strongly discouraged.

### White List

New users will be provided a core set of rules to get started with and then expected to manage which rules load for them via the `[whitelisted]`

The number of Caster rules has grown  immensely in the past few years, which is great, but means that the  initial load time has grown as well.

In order to reduce boot time, new configuration has been added to  allow the user to control which rules get `loaded`. Most users won't be  using the majority of the total available rules, so it doesn't make  sense to encumber most users with most of the rules.

### General notes

- Rules cannot be `enabled` that are not `loaded`. That is to say `AcrobatRule = false` It cannot be enabled and disabled For example saying  `enable acrobat`
- All grammars loaded by Caster including `user made` from `AppData\Local\caster\settings and `starter grammars from `Documents\Caster\castervoice will automatically be added to `[whitelisted]` as` true`.
- Speech recognition engine must restarted for changes in `[whitelisted]` to take effect.

The following `rules.toml `Is a mock representative of the default settings. `_enabled_ordered` shows the default enabled grammars when Caster first starts.

```toml
_enabled_ordered = ["Alphabet", "Navigation", "NavigationNon", "Numbers", "Punctuation", "CasterRule", "HardwareRule", "MouseAlternativesRule", "WindowManagementRule", "LegionGridRule", "DouglasGridRule", "RainbowGridRule", "SudokuGridRule", "HMCRule", "HMCConfirmRule", "HMCDirectoryRule", "HMCHistoryRule", "HMCLaunchRule", "HMCSettingsRule", "HistoryRule", "ChainAlias", "Alias", "DragonRule", "BringRule", "Again", "GrammarActivatorRule", "HooksActivationRule"]
_internal = ["GrammarActivatorRule", "HooksActivationRule", "TransformersActivationRule", "ManualGrammarReloadRule"]
