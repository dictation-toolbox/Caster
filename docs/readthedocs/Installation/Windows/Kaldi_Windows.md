# Kaldi - Classic Install

Caster currently supports Kaldi on Microsoft Windows 7 through Windows 10. Consider supporting the author [daanzu](https://github.com/sponsors/daanzu) if you use his engine full-time.

## 1. Python

- First Download and install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/) listed as `Windows installer (64-bit)`.

    Make sure to select `Add python to path`. This can be done manually by searching for "edit environment variables for your account" and adding your Python 3 folder to the list of Path values.

    Be sure the `wheel` package is installed. It can be installed with `pip install wheel` on a command line. You may need to update pip by running `pip install --upgrade pip` first.

## 2. Caster

1. Download Caster from the [master branch](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/Caster/archive/master.zip).
2. Open up the zip file downloaded
3. Copy the contents of `Caster-master` folder. You can put it anywhere, but it is common to use `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Caster`.
4. *Optional Step* for Caster's`Legion` MouseGrid - Legion Feature available on Windows 8 and above.
    - The Legion MouseGrid requires [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 (x86).](https://support.microsoft.com/en-nz/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) Note: Should not be needed if Windows 10 is up-to-date.
