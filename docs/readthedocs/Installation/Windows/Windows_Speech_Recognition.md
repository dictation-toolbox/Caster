# Windows Speech Recognition - Classic Install

Caster currently supports Windows Speech Recognition (WSR) on Microsoft Windows 7 through Windows 10.

### 1. Python

- **First** Download and install [Python v2.7.18 64-bit](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/) listed as `Windows x86-64 MSI installer` not Python 3.

- Make sure to select `Add python to path`. This can be done manually by searching for "edit environment variables for your account" and adding your Python folder to the list of Path values.

2. Open up the zip file downloaded
3. Copy the contents of `Caster-master` folder, you can put it anywhere but it is common to use `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Caster`.
4. *Optional Step* for Caster's`Legion` MouseGrid - Legion Feature available on Windows 8 and above
   - The Legion MouseGrid requires [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 (x86).](https://support.microsoft.com/en-nz/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) Note: Should not be needed if Windows 10 is up-to-date.

   **Troubleshooting Windows Speech Recognition**

- Receive the `-2147352567` COM error when Caster starts.
  
  ```
  com_error: (-2147352567, 'Exception occurred.', (0, None, None, None, 0, -2004287480), None)`
  ```
  
  - This is most likely related to the microphone being utilized by another program. See [issue #821](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/Caster/issues/821) and [#68](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/Caster/issues/68).  This can be mitigated by closing the program that's utilizing the microphone.
