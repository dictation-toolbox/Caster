## Running a Dragonfly Python file with WSR

In order to create a runnable Dragonfly .py file, you should create a Grammar object, add a Rule to it (as detailed in the Rule Construction page), and then add the following to the bottom of the file:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import pythoncom, time
    # Ignore this if you're using Dragon
    get_engine().recognize_forever()
```
