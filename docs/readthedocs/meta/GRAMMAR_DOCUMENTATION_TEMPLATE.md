# Title

<!-- Insert a short description here. -->

## Commands

- Very short command description: `<target> in code [<form>]`
  - Describe the variables here and add further explanation for this command. `<target>` is a variable that needs an explanation, for example. `<target>` might be _sauce_ or _dunce_. Refer to variables, e.g. `<form>`, using `backticks` and refer to spoken phrases using _italics_.

## Examples

- _sauce in code_
  - If not obvious what the example does, add a description here.
- _sauce in code form_
  - Try to cover a lot of different possible examples as lots of people learn this way before reading the proper documentation.
