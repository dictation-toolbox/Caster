# Caster

[Caster](http://dictation-toolbox.github.io/caster/) is a collection of tools aimed at enabling programming and accessibility entirely by voice built upon the [Dragonfly](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/dragonfly) API.

- Videos by the Caster Community.

- Caster Command Reference Guides 
    - [Caster](CasterQuickReference.pdf) - Universal navigation and editing - These commands are active all the time, and provide input commands for letters, numbers and punctuation, as well as the ability to easily manipulate windows and text. 
        - `window right` moves the active window to the right-hand side of the screen.
        - `prekris` inserts a pair of brackets `()` and moves the cursor inside them.
        - `shackle` selects the current line.
    - [Applications](readthedocs/Application_Commands_Quick_Reference.md) - Application specific control - These commands are only activated when a particular program is the active window, and they provide support for text editors, IDEs, web browsers etc. For example, while the Sublime text editor is the active window, saying
        - `find` will execute a `ctrl-f` keystroke, bringing up the find and replace prompt,
        - `open file` will execute a `ctrl-o` keystroke,
        - `edit next <n>` - `ctrl-d` n times, selecting the next n instances of the currently selected word.
    - [Program Languages](readthedocs/CCR_languages_Quick_Reference.md) - Language specific coding - These modules are activated and deactivated with the `enable/disable <language>` voice command. For example, saying `enable python`. 
        - `for loop` which will insert `for i in range(0, ):`
        - `print to console` - `print()`
        -  `open file` -  `open('filename', 'r') as f:`
