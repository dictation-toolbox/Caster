You can delete this message in castervoice\lib\ccr\core\\text_manipulation.py. 
Enable these commands by saying "enable text manipulation".
You may want to reduce the pause time in the

in castervoice\lib\\text_manipulation_functions.py 
These are a work in progress; please give feedback and

""" requires a recent version of dragonfly because of recent modification of the Function action
    # I think dragonfly2-0.13.0
    The wait times should be adjusted depending on the application by changing the numbers in copy_pause_time_dict
    and paste_pause_time_dict which are called by the functions text_manipulation_copy and text_manipulation_paste 
    in text_manipulation_functions.py. The wait times can be further adjusted by adjusting the sleep times in the 
    functions that those functions call: lib.context.read_selected_without_altering_clipboard 
    and lib.context.paste_string_without_altering_clipboard
    the keypress waittime should possibly be made shorter for these commands, though note that the keypress wait time is
    used by the aforementioned functions and lib.context.
    When these commands are not working in a particular application sometimes the problem is that 
    there is not enough time from when control-c is pressed until the contents of the clipboard are passed into the function
    In that case you need to increase the pause time in that application in copy_pause_time_dict
    
    The functions in text_manipulation_functions.py copy text into the clipboard and then return whatever
    you had there before back onto the clipboard. If you are using the multi clipboard (windows-x on Windows 10),
    this might be annoying because you will have some extra junk put on the second (and sometimes third) 
    slot on your multi clipboard. If you get the wait times exactly right, in principle
    this problem can be avoided using the functions lib.context.read_selected_without_altering_clipboard 
    and lib.context.paste_string_without_altering_clipboard
    In my experience, often times the paste part doesn't add
    any junk to the multi-clipboard although the copy (a.k.a. read) part does.
